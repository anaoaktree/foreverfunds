</p><!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >     The last twelve months have been busy, exciting, and productive. It is time to take stock of what
has been achieved, and how we envision the future. I also take this opportunity to thank all the
people &#8211; individual investors, professional asset managers, and seminar audiences &#8211; that have
given us their time, and engaged with our team on the topic of asset allocation over the last
year.

    <br 
class="newline" />I&#8217;m delighted to announce that Forever Funds SICAV - SIF is now ready for business. Year-long efforts
culminated early this June with the approval of the Luxembourg regulator, and a successful partnership
with Banque Degroof-Petercam. The fund is structured as an umbrella fund, which will let us develop a
full range of robust drawdown-controlled products, geared towards long-term investors. Banque
Degroof-Petercam will provide depositary, risk monitoring and compliance services. Ernst and Young
will serve as the fund&#8217;s auditor.
</p><!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >     The first fund released under the Forever Fund umbrella is the <span 
class="cmti-12">Forever Dynamic Core </span>fund.
Dynamic Core is an inexpensive high-quality multi-asset fund focused on risk management. It
invests in a basket of large, diversified and liquid indices that most investors already own.
This allows us to provide weekly liquidity. Risk and returns are optimized using minimax
drawdown-control: a dynamic approach that prevents large losses without sacrificing upside
exposure. During adverse market conditions, the fund may keep a significant share of its assets
in short-term treasuries or cash. Fund shares in Swiss Francs, Euros and US dollars are
available.
</p><!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >     The performance of the Dynamic Core Fund, backtested over the last 17 years, is an attractive one:
9% yearly returns in Swiss Francs, with a volatility of 7.5% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.1. It compares
                                                                                                                             

                                                                                                                                 
    favorably with our reference index, the LPP 40, which delivered annual returns of 3% for a
    volatility of 7.5%. Importantly, Dynamic Core manages to limit worst-case losses much more
    effectively: worst-case drawdowns for Dynamic Core are at 7.5%, against 23% for the LPP 40.

    <!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >     Live performance of the fund&#8217;s investment strategy since June 2016 confirms the backtest (the
    corresponding Managed Account will be audited by EY). The account&#8217;s performance in Swiss Francs
    over the last twelve months is 7.1%, with a volatility under 4.5% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.75! Over the
    same period, our reference index, the LPP40 delivered a performance of 5.3%, with a volatility of
    4.7% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.3. Provided this good performance continues to hold, the
    strategy will progressively increase its risk exposure until the 7.5% volatility target is reached.

       <br 
class="newline" />One of the really exciting applications of our robust risk management approach is to use it to take
    exposure to attractive returns-premia beyond bond and equity risk, for instance, carry and reversal
    premia. A limited exposure to such premia is included in Dynamic Core, and it has been successful in
    live trading over the last year. As a result, we have decided to iniate a second subfund &#8211; Forever
    Dynamic Edge &#8211; focused on harvesting high-performing returns premia in a robustly risk-managed
    way.
    </p><!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >     A key advantage of minimax drawdown-control is that it allows us to take significant exposure to
    attractive premia, with the confidence that downside risk is well controlled. We expect a high Sharpe
    ratio from this strategy, and robust risk management gives us the confidence to exploit it at scale. Our
    plans for Dynamic Edge reflect this vision. Backtested performance since 2002 delivers yearly returns of
    30% with a volatility around 15%. The strategy does not use direct leverage but purchases assets with
    some embedded leverage (e.g. ETFs). We initiated a managed account following this strategy mid-May,
    and when we feel sufficiently tested, we will initiate a corresponding fund open to investors.
